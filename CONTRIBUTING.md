## Ways to Contribute

- **Report a bug** — open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/abdullahkhfb/animepahe-enhancer/issues/new) with clear reproduction steps.
- **Request a feature** — open an issue describing the problem you want to solve and why it fits the project.
- **Fix a bug** — pick up an open issue labelled `bug` and open a pull request.
- **Build a feature** — discuss first in an issue, then implement it.
- **Improve the docs** — fix typos, clarify explanations, or add missing information in `README.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, `SECURITY.md`, or code comments.
- **Report a security vulnerability** — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the private disclosure process. Do **not** open a public issue.

---

## Ground Rules

- **Discuss before you build.** For anything beyond a trivial bug fix, open an issue first. This avoids duplicated effort and ensures the change aligns with the project's direction.
- **One concern per PR.** Keep pull requests focused. A PR that fixes a bug and adds an unrelated feature is harder to review and slows everything down.
- **No build step required.** The extension is plain ES2020+ JavaScript with no bundler, no TypeScript, and no external npm dependencies. Keep it that way.
- **Minimal permissions.** Any change that would require adding a new entry to `permissions` or `host_permissions` in `manifest.json` needs strong justification and will be scrutinised carefully.
- **Local-first data.** No feature should transmit user data to an external server beyond what is already documented (AniList title lookups for Smart Search, AniList/relations.yuna.moe/open-anime-timestamps requests for Intro/Outro Skip). New network targets require explicit discussion.
- **Be respectful.** This project adheres to its [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Development Setup

No build tools, no package manager, no Node.js — the repository _is_ the extension.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdullahkhfb/animepahe-enhancer.git
cd animepahe-enhancer
```

### Load in Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…**
3. Select `manifest.json` inside the cloned directory.

The extension stays active until Firefox is restarted. For persistent development, use a [Firefox developer profile](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/).

### Load in Chrome / Edge / other Chromium browsers

1. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`)
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the cloned directory.

### Reloading after changes

After editing any file:

- **Firefox:** click the reload icon next to the extension on `about:debugging`.
- **Chrome/Edge:** click the refresh icon on the extension card at `chrome://extensions`.

Then reload any open animepahe tab.

## Making Changes

### Bug Fixes

1. Confirm the bug is reproducible on the latest version.
2. Check that no existing open issue or PR already covers it.
3. Open an issue (or comment on the existing one) so work is tracked.
4. Fork the repository, create a branch named `fix/<short-description>`, make your change, and open a PR.

### New Features

Every feature in the extension follows a three-file contract:

**1. Create `content/features/my-feature.js`**

```js
export class MyFeature {
  constructor(storage, settings) {
    this.storage = storage;
    this.settings = settings; // the fully-merged object from storage.getSettings()
  }

  async init(pageType) {
    // Run only on the pages where this feature applies
    if (pageType !== "home") return;
    // … feature logic …
  }
}
```

**2. Add a settings key in `content/helpers/storage.js`**

```js
export const DEFAULT_SETTINGS = {
  cwEnabled: true,
  dubEnabled: true,
  smartSearchEnabled: true,
  introSkipEnabled: true,
  myFeatureEnabled: true, // ← add here
};
```

**3. Register the feature in `content/main.js`**

```js
const FEATURES = [
  // … existing entries …
  {
    module: "content/features/my-feature.js",
    export: "MyFeature",
    enabled: settings.myFeatureEnabled,
  },
];
```

**4. Expose the module in `manifest.json`** (if it needs to be importable by the content script)

```json
"web_accessible_resources": [
  {
    "resources": ["content/features/*.js", "content/helpers/*.js"],
    "matches": ["*://*.animepahe.pw/*", "..."]
  }
]
```

No other files need to change. If you add a toggle to the popup, update `popup/popup.html` and `popup/popup.js` accordingly.

### New Advanced Settings

If your change adds a tunable value (a timing, limit, batch size, etc.) rather than a new on/off feature, it almost certainly belongs in the **Advanced Settings** panel instead of a bespoke popup control. That panel is generated entirely from one schema — you don't touch `popup.html`, `popup.js`, or any CSS.

**1. Add an entry to `ADVANCED_SETTINGS_SCHEMA` in `content/helpers/storage.js`**, under an existing `group` or a new one:

```js
{
  key: "myNewTunable",
  label: "My new tunable",
  desc: "What this controls, in plain language.",
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  step: 1,
  default: 10,
}
```

**2. Read it wherever it's needed**, with a fallback to that same default:

```js
this._myValue = settings.myNewTunable ?? 10;
```

That's it. The popup will automatically render a labeled input, your description, and its own **↺ reset** button for the new setting, and fold it into **Reset All Advanced Settings** — no other files need to change.

A few conventions to follow:

- Pick a sensible `min`/`max` range — the input is hard-clamped to it on every change.
- `default` must match whatever the code already falls back to today, so existing users see no behavior change until they touch the new control.
- Keep `desc` to one plain-language sentence — it's read by people who don't necessarily know the implementation.
- If the value is shared by more than one feature (e.g. cache duration is read by both the DUB Detector and Smart Search), say so in `desc` rather than adding a second, duplicate setting.

### Documentation

- Edit `README.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, or `SECURITY.md` directly.
- Code comments are valued — explain _why_ something is done, not just _what_ it does.
- Architecture diagrams in the README use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax and render natively on GitHub.

## Code Style

There is no linter or formatter enforced by CI. Follow the conventions already in the codebase:

| Concern              | Convention                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax**           | ES2020+ — `async/await`, dynamic `import()`, optional chaining, nullish coalescing                                    |
| **Modules**          | Native ES modules (`export`/`import`). No CommonJS. No bundler.                                                       |
| **Naming**           | `camelCase` for variables and functions; `PascalCase` for classes; `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level constants  |
| **Indentation**      | 2 spaces                                                                                                              |
| **Strings**          | Double quotes for HTML attribute strings; single or template literals for JavaScript                                  |
| **DOM manipulation** | Prefer `createElement`/`appendChild` over `innerHTML` for any content that includes user-supplied, animepahe-sourced, or AniList-sourced data |
| **Error handling**   | Wrap feature initialisation in `try/catch` and log to `console.error` with the `[animepahe-enhancer]` prefix          |
| **Comments**         | JSDoc for exported classes and public methods; inline comments for non-obvious logic                                  |
| **Storage keys**     | All keys must use the established prefixes (`ape_`, `d2_`, `h2_`, `ape_ss_`, `ape_isid_`, `ape_askip_`) and be documented in `storage.js` or the relevant helper |

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/dub-badge-overlap
   # or
   git checkout -b feat/skip-intro-button
   ```

2. **Make your changes.** Test them manually by loading the extension and visiting the relevant animepahe pages.

3. **Write a clear commit message:**

   ```
   fix(dub-detector): prevent badge overlap on narrow episode cards

   Badges were clipping into the episode number when cards were narrower
   than 120 px. Fixed by reducing badge font size and padding at that width.

   Closes #42
   ```

4. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch. Fill in the PR template:
   - **What does this change?** — a concise summary.
   - **Why?** — the problem it solves or the improvement it makes.
   - **How was it tested?** — browsers tested, animepahe pages visited, edge cases checked.
   - **Screenshots or recordings** — strongly encouraged for UI changes.

5. **Respond to review feedback.** PRs that go unaddressed for 30 days without activity may be closed.

### Checklist before opening a PR

- [ ] Tested manually in at least one browser (Firefox or Chrome/Edge)
- [ ] No new `permissions` or `host_permissions` added without justification
- [ ] No `innerHTML` used with untrusted/third-party data (animepahe DOM, AniList responses)
- [ ] `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` updated if a new toggle was added
- [ ] `ADVANCED_SETTINGS_SCHEMA` updated (with a matching `default`) if a new tunable was added, instead of hand-rolling popup UI
- [ ] `manifest.json` `version` field **not** bumped (maintainer handles versioning)
- [ ] `README.md` updated if user-facing behaviour changed
- [ ] `PRIVACY.md` updated if new network targets or data flows were introduced
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` updated if new attack surface was introduced

## Issue Guidelines

Good issues save everyone time. Please include:

**For bug reports:**

- Extension version (visible in the popup footer or `manifest.json`)
- Browser name and version
- Operating system
- The animepahe URL or page type where the issue occurs
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
- Browser console errors (open DevTools → Console while on the affected page)

**For feature requests:**

- The problem you are trying to solve
- Your proposed solution (optional but helpful)
- Any alternative approaches you considered

Use the existing issue labels to help triage:

| Label              | Meaning                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `bug`              | Confirmed misbehaviour               |

## Release Process

Releases are handled by the maintainer. Contributors do **not** bump the version or create releases.

When a release is ready:

1. The `version` field in `manifest.json` is bumped following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
2. A GitHub Release is published with a tag matching `v<version>`.
3. The [`deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) workflow automatically:
   - Packages the extension into `Animepahe-Enhancer.zip`
   - Submits to the Firefox AMO review queue
   - Submits to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons dashboard
   - Attaches the zip to the GitHub Release
